<h1 align="center">The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</h1>

<p><b>Description:</b> This library contains the constructive proof of
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, along the lines of the proof of
Kneser, which originally appeared in Kneser?? (but see also TvD?? for
a presentation). We have adapted (improved and made more precise, as
we would view it) the proof quite a bit; an account of the formalised
mathematical proof is presented in GeuWieZwa??. This library rests on
the algebraic hierarchy, which defines all the basic concepts, like
the reals, the complex numbers, polynomials etc. The FTA library
contains more specific operations on and properties of the reals, the
complex numbers and polynomials, required for the FTA
proof. Furthermore it contains the Kneser proof, devided in 4 stages.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>results about preservation of continuity through algebraic operations;</li>
  <li>the usual rules for derivation;  - formalization of power series and
Taylor series;</li>
  <li>several formulations of Rolle's Theorem, the Mean Law, convergence
theorems and error estimates for Taylor series;</li>
  <li>the Key Lemma and the Main Lemma, stating results about 
(finite sequences of) reals, specifically needed for FTA. (These 
are more or less implicit in the original proof of Kneser);</li>
  <li>the Kneser Lemma</li>
  <li>FTA for regular polynomials (i.e. where we know that the leading coefficient is 1);</li>
  <li>FTA for arbitrary non-constant polynomials.</li>
</ul>
