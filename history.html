The C-CoRN repository grew out of the 
<a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/fta/">FTA project</a>, where
a constructive proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra was formalized in Coq.  This
theorem states that every non-constant polynomial f over the complex
numbers has a root, i.e. there is a complex number z such that f(z) = 0.
The FTA project was performed by Herman Geuvers, Freek Wiedijk, Jan
Zwanenburg, Randy Pollack, Milad Niqui, and Henk Barendregt. The
motivations for starting this project were the following
<UL>
<LI> Formalize a large piece of real mathematics. See whether it can be done and which
  problems arise. 
<LI> Create a library for basic constructive algebra and analysis, to
be used by others. Often, a formalization is only used by the person
that created it (or is not used further at all!), whereas one of the
goals of formalizing mathematics is to create a joint repository of
mathematics.
<LI> Investigate the current limitations of theorem provers, notably
Coq, and the type theoretic approach towards theorem proving.
<LI> Manage this project. Work with a group of people on one
theory/proof-development. Initially, the following three sequential/parallel
phases were distinguished:
<UL>
<LI> Mathematical proof: LaTeX document (the mathematical proof with
lots of details filled in) 

<LI> Theory development: Coq file (just definitions and statements of
lemmas) 
<LI> Proof development: Coq file (formal proofs filled in)
</UL>

The goal is to keep these phases consistent, so the theory/proof
development process proceeds in a ``literate programming'' style: by
working (in parallel) on three documents, one creates a complete
formal development of FTA, together with a documentation, which
consists of the LaTeX document (the high level specification) and the
theory development (the low level specification, containing all the
precise definitions and names of lemmas etc.) It is not trivial to
keep these phases consistent (and in fact in FTA this consistency has
not been maintained till the end): a lemma in the LaTeX version may
be just wrong, a definition may be incomplete or the `basic
properties' that one thinks one needs (say about fields) are just not
the ones that one really needs.  

<LI> Constructive proof. We view a
real number as a (potentially) infinite object. So the equality on
them is undecidable and one can not define functions by cases. A good
thing is that we are actually proving the correctness of a
root-finding algorithm. Details of the proof can be found in
{GeuversWiedijkZwanenburg-TYPES-2001}.
</UL>

The proof did not proceed by constructing the reals in Coq, but by axiomatic
reasoning. So the axioms of the real numbers were defined in
Coq. As a matter of fact, we have proceeded even more generally by
first defining an algebraic hierarchy (semi-groups, monoids, groups,
rings, fields, ordered fields); see
{GeuversPollackWiedijkZwanenburg-JSC-2002}. The advantages of this
approach are: reuse of proven results and reuse of notation. (The
reals and complex numbers are fields and the polynomials form a ring.)
Then IR was defined to be an (arbitrary) Cauchy-complete
Archimedean ordered field. Given such an IR, the complex numbers can be
defined by CC := IR x IR.  To make sure that the axioms for IR make
sense, a concrete instantiation for IR has been constructed by Niqui.
<BR>
Completely formalized in the theorem prover Coq, the proof and theory
development amounts to the following. This is the size of the input files (definitions,
lemmas, tactic scripts)
<UL>
<LI> Sets and Basics  41 kb
<LI> Algebra (up to Ordered Fields)  165 kb
<LI> Reals  52 kb
<LI> Polynomials  113 kb
<LI> Real-valued functions / Basic Analysis  30 kb
<LI> Complex numbers  98 kb
<LI> FTA proof  70 kb 
<LI> Construction of IR 309 kb
<LI> Rational Tactic  49 kb
</UL>

To modularize the proof and in order to create a real ``library'', we
have first defined an algebraic hierarchy in the FTA project. In
proving FTA, we have to deal with real numbers, complex numbers and
polynomials and many of the properties we use are generic and
algebraic. To be able to reuse results (also for future developments)
we have defined a hierarchy of algebraic structures.  The basic level
consists of constructive setoids, (A, #, =), with
A: Set, # an apartness and = an equivalence
relation. (Classically, apartness is just the negation of equality,
but constructively, apartness is more `primitive' than equality and
equality is usually defined as the negation of apartness. To
understand this, think of two reals x and y as (infinite) Cauchy
sequences: we may determine in a finite amount of time whether x # y,
but we can in general never know in a finite amount of time that
x=y.)
On the next level we have semi-groups, (S, +), with S a
setoid and + an associative binary operation on S.
<P>
Inside the algebraic hierarchy we have `inheritance via coercions'.
We have the following coercions.
<BR>   
OrdField >-> Field >-> Ring >-> Group 
              Group >-> Monoid >-> Semi_grp >-> Setoid
<BR>
This means that
all properties of groups are inherited by rings,
fields, etc.
Also notation is inherited:
x[+]y
denotes the addition of x and y for x,y:G from any semi-group (or monoid, group, ring,...) G. 
The coercions must form a tree, so there is no real 
multiple inheritance,
e.g. it is not
possible to define rings in such a way that it inherits both from its
additive group and its multiplicative monoid.
<P>
In the proof of FTA we needed
proofs of equalities between rational expressions.
These were automatized using so called `partial reflection'.
<P>
The axioms for real numbers are (apart from the fact that the reals
form a constructive ordered field)
<UL>
<LI> All Cauchy sequences have a limit:<BR>
SeqLim : {g: nat ->F | Cauchy(g)} -> F<BR>
CauchyProp: forall g: nat->F. Cauchy(g) -> forall e: F{>0}. exists N: nat.forall m>= N.(|g_m - SeqLim(g)|<e)<BR>
<LI> Axiom of Archimedes: (there are no non-standard elements)<BR>
forall x: F. exists n: nat (n>x)
</UL>

The axiom of Archimedes proves that `epsilon-Cauchy sequences' and 
`1/k-Cauchy sequences' coincide (and similar for limits).
Viz: g:nat->F is a 1/k-Cauchy sequence if<BR>
forall k: nat. \exists N:nat.forall m\geq N(|g_m - g_N|
<1/k
<P>

To be sure that our axioms can be satisfied, we have also constructed
a Real Number Structure via the standard technique of taking the Cauchy
sequences of rational numbers and defining an appropriate apartness on
them. It turns out (as was to be expected) that real number structures
are categorical: Any two real number structures are isomorphic. This
fact has been proved within Coq.
<P>
In conclusion we have found:
<UL>
<LI> Real mathematics, involving both a
bit of algebra and a bit of analysis can be formalized completely
within a theorem prover (Coq).  
<LI> Setting up a basic library and some
good proof automation procedures is a substantial part of the work.
<LI> An important issue remains how to present the development (and the
proof). In the formalization process, the connection with the LaTeX
file has been abandoned. We believe that it is essential to provide a
system in which one can write the formalization and the documentation
in one file.  
<LI> Work is in progress regarding the extraction of the algorithm implicit
in the proof.  This has turned out to be far from trivial, and has provided
important insight in issues such as how the sorts of Coq should be used.
